            <h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
            <p>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye
            must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind,
            yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the
            gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation
            whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>

            <h2>Ether 12:32</h2>
            <p>And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house for man, yea, even among the mansions of thy
            Father, in which man might have a more excellent hope; wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in
            the place which thou hast prepared.
