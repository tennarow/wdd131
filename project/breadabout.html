                <p>Hello! My name is Tenna King. I was born and raised in Mesa, Arizona. I live here now with my husband
                and daughter. I am currently a nanny for a 5 month old baby and I bring 18 month daughter to work. My
                husband and I are expecting another girl in October. I am a foodie to the core. I have always loved experiementing 
                in the kitchen. Sourdough baking has allowed me to do just that! My love for food and creating have made something magical 
                and I love to share my bread with the world. </p>

                <p>My sourdough began on the other side of the world! I lived in Slovenia for 18 months and while I was there I met a friend who shared her starter with me. My first few loafs were not very pretty, but that is where it all began. I still use the same Slovenian starter today!</p>
